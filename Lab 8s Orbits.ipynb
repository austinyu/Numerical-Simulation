    "Today we will be looking at numerical solutions to the two-body problem.  We will work these problems in the center-of-mass frame of reference. As we often do in computing, we will first attempt a calculation to which we know the answer.  We will then attack a second problem that is more complex and cannot be solved analytically. We will start out by reducing the two-body problem to a one-body problem by solving for and plotting the motion of the *reduced mass* about the fixed center of mass of the system.  Later in the lab we will switch to plotting the motion of *both* bodies with a simple coordinate transform.  \n",
